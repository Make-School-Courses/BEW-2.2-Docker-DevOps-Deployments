## Course Description

In this course students will learn the two main flavors of Developer Operations (DevOps), one that uses containers and one that does not. Students will learn the leading container pattern with Docker and explore the pros and cons of containers by implementing them. Students will also learn about DevOps without containers using AWS and S3 tools. The course will tie both these patterns together with generic patterns of operation, such as environmental design, development controls, and uptime management.

## Prerequisites

- [BEW1.1](https://make.sc/bew1-1)
- [BEW1.2](https://make.sc/bew1-2)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to ...

1. Build and deploy an application that utilizes container developer operations
1. Compare and contrast when to use container or container-less developer operations
1. Implement generic patterns of operation for both types of developer operation patterns
1. Demonstrate proficiency for professional DevOps roles
