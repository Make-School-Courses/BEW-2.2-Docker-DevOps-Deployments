## Course Description

In this course students will learn the two main flavors of Developer Operations (DevOps), one that uses containers and one that does not. Students will learn the leading container pattern with Docker and explore the pros and cons of containers by implementing them. The course will tie this pattern together with generic patterns of operation, such as environmental design, development controls, and uptime management.

## Prerequisites

- [BEW 1.1](https://make.sc/bew1-1)
- [BEW 1.2](https://make.sc/bew1-2)

## Learning Outcomes

_By the end of this course, you will be able to&hellip;_

1. Build, deploy, and orchestrate that containers in any web-based application.
1. Compare and contrast traditional and container-based deployment patterns.
1. Demonstrate proficiency for professional DevOps roles.
1. Implement and maintain a cloud infrastructure utilizing traditional DevOps techniques.
