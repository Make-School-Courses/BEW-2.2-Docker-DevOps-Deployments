## [**10m**] **Warm Up**: Disaster Scenarios

In breakout groups of 4, discuss and record **every way** something could go wrong with a deployed application.

Example scenario: _The server lost power due to a severe thunderstorm._

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **Discuss**: Disaster Scenarios

Call on students and ask them to contribute what they discussed to a running list of disaster scenarios.

We'll be talking about how to mitigate many of these risks today!

<!-- > -->


## [**10m**] **TT**: Avoiding Disaster

Today, we'll cover several ways to know and be notified when you're site goes down.

First, let's learn how we can check manually using our terminal.

### Command Line Tools

<!-- > -->

#### Ping

Test the `ping` command using your server's IP address or hostname.

```sh
ping 111.111.111.111
```

```sh
ping captain.dev.YOURDOMAIN.COM
```

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **TT**: Automating Uptime Monitoring

These manual techniques work great when you're sitting in front of your computer. But what if you're AFK? How will we know the server is down?

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **Activity**: Set Up an Uptime Monitor

1. Go to [FreshPing] and use the form on the left to create a new account:
   1. Enter `https://captain.dev.YOURDOMAIN.COM` in the first field.
   1. Enter your email address in the second field.
1. Click the activation link sent to your email. _Required to receive alerts reliably._
1. **FreshPing adds your first server automatically. You're all done!**

Use the remaining time to explore FreshPing's interface.

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **TT**: Status Pages

**Status pages**:

- Communicate incidents, scheduled maintenances and downtimes.
- Can either be public or private.
  - Private status pages communicate incidents with internal teams only
- Helps you build customer trust.
- Showcase the reliability of your platform
  - Historical uptime
  - Performance timeline of your service
- Control over how you communicate an incident
- Notify customers in real-time with updates to incidents and scheduled maintenance
- Reduce the number of phone calls or tickets when the site goes down.
- Should be hosted on a server other than the one(s) you're monitoring.
- Help you learn more about how fast you respond to downtime.
- Should always be hosted on a different server and network than the servers you're monitoring.

<!-- > -->

## [**05m**] **Demo**: BEW 2.2 Dashboard

Demonstrate a status page that monitors all servers for the course: [make.sc/bew2.2-dashboard].

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **Activity**: Set Up a Status Page

1. Add a status page on [FreshPing].
1. Add `captain.dev.YOURDOMAIN.com` to the status page.
1. Paste the URL for your status page in chat.

We will be adding additional alerting and status indicators when we discuss [Docker Swarms].

## [**10m**] **TT**: Resource Monitoring

### Introducing Netdata

**Netdata is**:

1. A metrics collector for system and application metrics (including web servers, databases, containers, and much more)
1. A long-term metrics database that stores recent metrics in memory and "spills" historical metrics to disk for efficient long-term storage
1. A super fast, interactive, and modern metrics visualizer optimized for anomaly detection
1. An alarms notification engine for detecting performance and availability issues

See **[Why Netdata]** for more.

### Industry Use

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2662304/48305662-9de82980-e537-11e8-9f5b-aa1a60fbb82f.png">

Used by Amazon, DigitalOcean, Google, Groupon, Microsoft, NewRelic, Nvidia, TicketMaster, Vimeo, and more!

See [Netdata User Base] for the full list.

### What Netdata Monitors

- CPU
- Memory
- Disks
- Filesystems
- Networking
- Containers
- Log files

See the full list of [supported collectors].

Netdata's data collection is **extensible**, which means you can monitor anything you can get a metric for. You can even write a collector for your custom application!

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **Activity**: Working With Netdata

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80827388-b9fee100-8b98-11ea-8f60-0d7824667cd3.gif">

<!-- > -->

### Step 1: Enable Netdata

1. Log in to CapRover.
1. Choose **Monitoring** from the sidebar.
1. Click the `Start Netdata Engine` button on the middle of the page.

### Step 2: Enable Alerts

Send email alerts to your gmail account by scrolling down to Notification Settings and entering the following data in the **Email (SMTP)** section:

- **Recipient Email**: `youraccount@gmail.com`
- **Server Tag**: `CapRover`
- **SMTP Server**: `smtp.gmail.com`
- **SMTP Port**: `587`
- **Unsecure**: Leave unchecked
- **SMTP Username**: `youraccount@gmail.com`
- **SMTP Password**: `your_gmail_password` (will be hidden after submitting)

Click `Update Netdata` to finish.

<!-- > -->

### Step 3: Discover the Dashboard

Browse the dashboard by clicking `Open Netdata`!

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] **Wrap Up**: Poll / Q+A

Present students with a Zoom poll to determine their progress for the day.

Use the remaining time to answer questions before dismissing class.
