## [**20m**] 💻 **Challenge**: Deploy a Tarfile

**GOAL**: Practice the most approachable deployment mechanism --- upload a tarfile on CapRover, then deploy it.

1. Visit [caprover/captain-sample-apps](https://github.com/caprover/caprover/tree/master/captain-sample-apps).
1. Choose a `.tar` file for a sample app, and download it. **Recommended**:
   - Python/Django
   - Go
   - Node
   - React
1. Go to `https://captain.dev.YOURDOMAIN.COM` in your browser.
1. From the left menu, select Apps and create a new app.
1. Name it `first-app`.
1. Go to "Deployment" tab and upload the tar file, then wait for the deployment to complete.
1. The first time you build, it'll take a few minutes. After the build is completed, visit `https://first-app.dev.YOURDOMAIN.COM`.
1. **CONGRATS! Your app is live!!** When complete, celebrate by posting the link to your working deployment on the `#bew2-2-docker` Slack channel!

If you get stuck, review the following guide to deploying on CapRover: [Complete Webapp Tutorial](https://caprover.com/docs/complete-webapp-tutorial.html)

1. Visit [caprover/captain-sample-apps](http://github.com/caprover/caprover/tree/master/captain-sample-apps).

   - Python/Django
   - Go
   - Node
   - React
1. Unzip the content by double-clicking the `.tar` file you downloaded, then open a terminal and navigate to the unzipped directory.
1. Run the deploy command below. Be sure to read carefully and follow the instructions once you execute it!

    ```sh
    caprover deploy
    ```

    Enter `second-deploy` when asked for the app name.
1. The first time you build, it’ll take a few minutes. After the build is completed, visit `second-deploy.dev.YOURDOMAIN.COM`.
