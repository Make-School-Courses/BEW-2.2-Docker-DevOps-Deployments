## üèÜ Objectives

1. Define _volume_ in the context of Docker.
1. Determine when and when not to persist data in your production-ready applications.
1. Practice persisting data using CapRover.

## [**20m**] Warm Up: Persistence & You

First, double-check that you've submitted your final project proposal repo link on [Gradescope]!

Then, we'll break out into groups to discuss the following questions together:

- **What is _data persistence_?**
- Name **at least use cases** where data persistence is necessary.
- Name **at least two examples** of persistent data storage.
- Have you ever had any **scenarios where your data did not persist** the way you wanted it to? **How did you fix it?**

Be sure to write down your answers --- we'll discuss after the activity!

## [**10m**] Discuss: Persistence & You

Call on members from each group and discuss answers together as a class.

## [**20m**] Activity: CapRover Persistent Apps

Read through the [Persistent Apps](https://caprover.com/docs/persistent-apps.html) documentation and answer the following questions in groups of two:

- When should an app be persistent?
- When shouldn't it be?

Give specific examples of each!

## [**10m**] Demo: Persist Data on Production
