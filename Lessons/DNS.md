### 🏆 [5m] Learning Objectives

By the end of this class you will be able to...
1. explain the role of DNS and domain names 
2. trace a request using the `traceroute` command
3. register a domain name + link to GitHub Pages
4. be fully prepared for the next set of Docker lessons

### 📚 [15m] Review DNS Comic

##### ACTIVITY

Students should enter breakout rooms and go through this [DNS comic which explains with graphics how DNS systems work and communicate!](https://howdns.works)

Take notes on the vocabulary term that comes up in each page and "trace" the example ping from the comic.

Upon return to the main room, the instructor should "trace" the example ping to see if it matches the students understanding.

### 🔥 [10m] Trace a request 

##### ACTIVITY

Open breakout rooms for 10 minutes and experiment with `traceroute` command.

Use the `traceroute` terminal command with the following websites and explore the output:
- google.com
- makeschool.com
- nsa.gov

What's going on with the nsa.gov `traceroute`? Seems like a strange behavior...

Discussion questions (Google them if nobody knows):
- what happens if we paste the IP addresses found in the route into a web browser?
- How does the route change with a VPN?
- What would happen if we were using a TOR browser?
- Can we truly mask our activity on the internet?

### [30m] 🗣️ Register a Domain Name + Link to GitHub

##### -- Instructor Demo --

A .xyz domain name can be purchased from [namecheap.com for ~$1.](namecheap.com)

Reference materials:
- Great guide to [connect a namecheap.com domain to GitHub Pages](https://dev.to/pauljwil/connect-github-pages-to-your-namecheap-domain-4gjj)
- Documentation from GitHub that specifies current IP address to use for your domains `A Records`.
- Troubleshooting [tips from GitHub for ideas to use when things don't work](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages#cname-errors)
-- NOTE: dropping the CNAME certificate and then readding seems to be the best quick debugging fix for namecheap.com

Demonstrate a working set of `CNAME` and `A Record` properties using the `dig` command. As of June 2021, it should include four `A Records` and one `CNAME`.

EX:
```
