### Demo Code

View the demo code on Github at [droxey/docker-flask](https://github.com/droxey/docker-flask).

## [**60m**] 🔭 Lab: Writing Dockerfiles

Add a `Dockerfile` file to an existing project that implements a web server.

**IMPORTANT: Be sure to add this file to a project you've already completed in another course. BEW 2.2 focuses on enhancing your existing codebases, rather than starting new repositories from scratch.**

Past students have utilized projects from the following courses to complete this challenge:

- **[SPD 1.5](https://make.sc/spd1.5)**: Simplify day to day development for your SPD team by ensuring your application and it's dependencies run the same on each team member's machine.
- **[BEW 1.1](https://make.sc/bew1.1)**: Dockerize a Flask project.
- **[BEW 1.2](https://make.sc/bew1.2)**: Dockerize a Django project.
- **[BEW 1.3](https://make.sc/bew1.3)**: Dockerize a Node project.
