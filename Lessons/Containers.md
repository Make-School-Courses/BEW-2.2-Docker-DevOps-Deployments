## Why You Should Know This

The ability to start, stop, and execute arbitrary commands from within containers is a core tenet of Docker!

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify and describe how to list, start, stop a Docker container.
2. Determine the difference between running and stopped containers.
3. Apply filtering and formatting techniques that make reading `docker ps` output much easier.
4. Execute commands from within a Docker container.

## Initial Exercise (25 min)

### Day 3 Checkpoint (15 min)

1. Update the tracker with your current progress.
2. Open [this link](https://pollev.com/droxey) to take a short, non-graded, anonymized quiz about what you learned last class period.
3. In 15 minutes, we will review the answers together before getting started on our live code activity for the day.

### Review (10 min)

Review the answers with the class.


## TT (40 min)

### Live Code Part II

Go through the [Docker From the Ground Up: Part 2](Resources/DockerFromTheGroundUp.md#part-2) tutorial live with the class.

Ask them to close their laptops as they watch you complete the tutorial.

## In Class Activity I (40 min)

### Students Do: P2

Now it's YOUR turn to complete [Docker From the Ground Up: Part 2](Resources/DockerFromTheGroundUp.md#part-2).

1. **Complete Part 2** of the tutorial.
2. **Add the :whale: emoji to the Slack message that Dani posts to indicate that you've finished the tutorial**.
3. Work on your [KataCoda](www.katacoda.com/courses/docker) challenges once done!

### Instructor Do: Slack Message, P2

Post the following message on Slack after kicking off the activity:

Add the `:whale:` emoji to this message to indicate that you've completed the Docker from the Ground Up tutorial!
