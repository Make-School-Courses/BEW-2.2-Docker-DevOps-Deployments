### Instructor Prep

**Slack the following message at the start of class**:

## Why You Should Know This (2 min)

Knowing the current DevOps landscape will enable you to focus on learning the right DevOps skills in our modern-day software engineering ecosystem.

## Learning Objectives (3 min)

1. Discover the 2019 DevOps roadmap and how it affects what you learn in this class.
2. Define a DevOps Dictionary and populate some of useful terms.
3. Practice practical Docker commands on your local machine.

## Initial Exercise (5 min)

It takes a while to download and install Docker on your laptop. **Please start now**!

1. [Click this link](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) to download the image.

3. Add the :whale: emoji to the pinned Slack message in `#bew2-2` when installation is finally complete.

## Activity I (20 min)

### Too Many Words, So Little Time

1. **Open** up the 2019 DevOps roadmap [found here](Resources/Roadmap.md). In another tab, open the [lesson plan](Archive/2019-T4/Lessons/Lesson1.md) that we went over last class.
2. **Read** through the roadmap/lesson plan and **write down any words, phrases, or terminology you are unfamiliar with**, or **would like to learn more about**.
3. When you're done, **share your list with a partner**. Discuss and compare!
4. Define as many terms as you can, starting with any terms you and your partner had in common.
5. **Write your own definition** for each word or phrase.
   1. ***You can use Google to research, but please write the definitions in your own voice!***
6. Slack the class channel (`#bew2-2`) and paste the list of definitions you've created in a single message.
   1. We'll be watching your posts on Slack projected live!
7. **Dani will compile these into a Vocabulary Guide as her homework assignment tonight!**
